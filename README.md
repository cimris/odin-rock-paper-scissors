Rock, Paper, Scissors Project from The Odin Project

This was my first real go at independently using JavaScript to create a "game" of some sort. While I understood the concepts behind the previous FizzBuzz project, and actually figured out how to do it on my own after the first step, this project was very much completely from scratch.

I got a better handle on just how functions, variables, and inputs can all be put together for a (beyond) basic Rock Paper Scissors game that uses a loop to play 5 rounds and keep track of the winner. I do feel that there could be optimizations and ways to clean up the code significantly, however, for a first draft I am happy with the result so far. Later I will create a User Interface to interact with while maintaining the game logic so it isn't just a bunch of alert windows.
