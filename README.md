Rock, Paper, Scissors Project from The Odin Project

This was my first real go at independently using JavaScript to create a "game" of some sort. While I understood the concepts behind the previous FizzBuzz project, and actually figured out how to do it on my own after the first step, this project was very much completely from scratch.

I got a better handle on just how functions, variables, and inputs can all be put together for a (beyond) basic Rock Paper Scissors game that uses a loop to play 5 rounds and keep track of the winner. I do feel that there could be optimizations and ways to clean up the code significantly, however, for a first draft I am happy with the result so far. Later I will create a User Interface to interact with while maintaining the game logic so it isn't just a bunch of alert windows.

I began the UI for the Rock, Paper, Scissors game. It is a fairly simple front-end, with black and yellow styling. My goal is to have the interface for the player to make their choice, to have the computer choice displayed, and to keep a tally on the scoreboard for a "first to five" win condition. Having the computer choice shown on the UI will likely be challenging and may be the last thing I add.

However, the front end was incredibly simple and easy to make compared to how long it used to take me to position things with HTML/CSS. Improvement!

I walked away from this project for a bit due to work, but luckily, when I came back I found my code fairly readable. Quite happy about that. Once I regained my footing getting the document selectors up and running as variables - to save myself some time - and reworking the functions came pretty easily. Once I got the hand of one selector I found getting the rest in line rather simple.
